### directory "network"
- shortest paths through dfs
- shortest paths through Dijkstra
- use Disjoint Set to check whether a network is connected
- shortest paths through Floyd
- k-shortest paths through Yen's Algorithm and dfs, dfs can make test cases for Yen's Algorithm
- routing algorithm of the paper "R2T‑DSDN reliable real‑time distributed controller‑based SDN"

### directory "random"
- generate random numbers that follow Poisson distribution
- generate random numbers that follow Normal distribution through rejection sampling
- generate random numbers that follow Normal distribution through Box-Muller
